        forthcoming book by Nancy Vedder-Shults)</span><br>

        <br>

        <b>Invoking Goddess Fire: A Sermon</b><br>

        <br>

      <p>INTRODUCTORY REFLECTIONS</p>

      <p>The erotic -- our society's understanding of our bodies, of sexuality 

        and sensuality -- has been problematic since before Western culture was 

        in the West. Adam's and Eve's troubles in the Garden bedeviled Judaism 

        well before they caused problems for the Christians. Buttressing its customs 

        with the story of Eden, Judaism instituted controls on reproduction and 

        honored the spirit above the sensual, honored Yahweh by denying the prepatriarchal 

        goddesses whose sexuality and birthgiving were the major metaphors for 

        creativity. But as Nietzsche once observed, it was &quot;Christianity 

        [who] gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it, but degenerated 

        into a vice.&quot; The early Christians declared lust and gluttony to 

        be two of their seven cardinal sins, each of them sins of the flesh. When 

        the Calvinists came along during the Protestant Reformation several centuries 

        later, they went even further in their denial of the body. They enforced 

        what St. Jerome had denounced in the early centuries of the church when 

        he said, &quot;Regard everything as poison which bears within it the seed 

        of sensual pleasure.&quot;1</p>

      <p>Although much of this extreme anti-body sentiment had died out by the 

        time I was born, while I was growing up in the Dutch Reformed Church, 

        a Calvinist church much like the Puritan churches in England or the Americas, 

        we weren't allowed to dance or play cards on Sunday. Today Christian megachurches 

        are displacing the split of body and mind implicit in the religion of 

        my childhood by presenting the &quot;Word of God&quot; through drama, 

        rock music, dance, lighting and spectacle, forms that speak to the senses 

        more than to the intellect. <br>

      </p>

      <p>But most Americans, I think, are still plagued with the fall-out from 

        the Garden of Eden, especially a denial of the senses and of the erotic, 

        although it is not as blatant as it was 50 years ago. If you doubt this, 

        just look at the kind of art exhibits or photo displays that are censored 

        in our communities. Just this past winter, the Concourse Hotel in Madison 

        pulled down a number of photographs in an exhibit there, because they 

        contained nudity. Their justification: that they are a family establishment. 

        It didn't matter to the management that these were art photos, just that 

        they contained naked figures. <br>

      </p>

      <p>So today we're going to explore the erotic in our lives, first by creating 

        sacred space, an environment in which we can put aside our more mundane 

        existence and see our bodies as the miracles they are. We began by calling 

        the directions as represented by four deities who embody their own element 

        (earth--the physical, air--the intellectual, water--the emotional) as 

        potentiated by fire, the element of passion. Then we invoked Aphrodite, 

        the goddess of love, to infuse us with her energy. Next I will offer some 

        poetic readings about Inanna, the ancient Mesopotamian goddess who was 

        the garden, the luscious fruit, Eve and the snake all rolled into one 

        before the Hebrews rewrote the myth for their own purposes. Following 

        this, I will continue my reflections on the erotic in our lives. And finally 

        we will return to our more mundane reality by dismissing the directions 

        and thanking Aphrodite for blessing our circle today.</p>

      <p>THE EROTIC AS A SOURCE OF POWER</p>

      <p>You might wonder how I could blithely assert, as I did a few minutes 

        ago, that eros remains poisoned 100 years after Nietzsche declared that 

        Christianity had transformed it into a vice. After all, you might assume 

        that by the 21st century the U.S. has become a secular society, little 

        affected by Christian mores. Following the Monica Lewinsky debacle, you 

        might even surmise that we're anything but Puritan in our sexual ethics, 

        that, in fact, we're a sex-obsessed culture. That is just what Frank Rich 

        implied at the height of Bill Clinton's impeachment hearings in an op-ed 

        piece for the New York Times. He said, &quot;There remains one common 

        denominator that unites us all: sex. We have a sex-addicted president, 

        a sex-obsessed independent counsel, sex-crazed media and a public so entranced 

        by sex that not even McGwire or Sosa (remember them?) can entice us to 

        spend more dollars on Major League Baseball than we do on videos rated 

        XXX. To each American, apparently, his or her own home run.&quot;<br>

      </p>

      <p>Why then do we need to talk about overturning our cultural inhibitions 

        about sex? Hasn't this scandal done that already? Isn't it time to talk 

        of other things? I have to admit that the sensationalistic reporting of 

        every salacious detail from this affair made me as sick as the next person. 

        But I don't think public fixation on the presidential penis is a healthy 

        development of the American libido. Rather it seems to represent one more 

        step in the polarization of our society around sexual issues. On the one 

        hand, we find the retrenchment of rightwing Christians, using Puritan 

        values to oppose abortion, birth control and even sex education in the 

        schools, because they believe sexuality is sinful outside the sanctions 

        of the church. And on the other hand, we see the pornography business 

        flourishing, making over $10 billion a year in profits; prime time serving 

        up sexually-explicit shows for even our youngest kids to watch; and women's 

        clothes becoming more revealing with every season, what with lingerie 

        worn out-of-doors while bustiers and bras are worn as outer garments. 

      </p>

      <p>I think the erotic is very confusing for most people in this culture, 

        because of our Puritan heritage. We immediately see eros as tied to genital 

        sexuality, flattening out the possibilities that this term encompasses. 

        Instead of shooting his arrows indiscriminately in our lives, Eros -- 

        we assume -- only aims at our love life, and then only when we're ready 

        to hop in the sack with the sex partner of our dreams.</p>

      <p>In contrast, many New Age philosophers have begun to speak of eros as 

        the glue that binds the universe together, the allurement of one body 

        for another, whether those bodies are human or stellar. But broadening 

        out eros to include gravity, the attraction of one physical object for 

        another, seems somewhat absurd and also reductionistic to me. Intergalactic 

        lust may sound appealing as a universal bonding agent, but in human terms 

        it's pretty abstract. Eros seems more useful if we confine it to human 

        interactions where it can take on many more connotations than pure physical 

        attraction.</p>

      <p>Perhaps if we thought in terms of passion, the erotic would come into 

        focus for us. We can feel passion for a person, for an endeavor, for an 

        object, for a pastime; for work or play. Anything or anyone that lights 

        up our lives can engender passion, not just someone who attracts us sexually. 

        Some people are known as passionate, because they feel strongly about 

        almost everything in their lives. They have a joie de vivre and an &eacute;lan 

        vitale, concepts we feel more comfortable expressing in French, keeping 

        them linguistically at an arm's length. These charismatic people are glad 

        to be alive, self-confident in their purposes and emotionally expressive, 

        the antithesis of the Puritan demeanor that still haunts our culture.</p>

      <p>We don't have to look far to find the reason for this contrast. Puritanism 

        was a religion of control and repression, clamping down the lid on the 

        energy of the life force, not just sexually, but also in the arenas of 

        everyday demeanor, clothing and even play. A modern-day equivalent would 

        be the Amish, who, although they are descended from a different branch 

        of the Protestant Reformation, also control the lives of their members 

        with strict prohibitions on clothes other than those with the prescribed 

        style and color, prohibitions on adorning their houses with any paintings 

        or photographs (a prohibition most Amish households circumvent by buying 

        picture calendars for many of their living areas), while likewise forbidding 

        modern vehicles and machinery. Puritanism tried -- as the Amish still 

        attempt -- to channel the eros of its followers into acceptable arenas, 

        into work and church, shutting down the vitality of other endeavors.</p>

      <p>In reacting against our Puritan legacy in the (so-callled) sexual revolution, 

        Americans have only begun to scratch the surface to discover our own authentic 

        eros. I think this is generally true with rebellions against former restrictions. 

        Rebels tend to accept the definitions of the former culture and act out, 

        as a result, in more limited ways. What surfaces are the compulsions generated 

        by oppression and by restrictions, giving way to what the Germans call 

        Narrenfreiheit (a fool's freedom), not true freedom. <br>

      </p>

      <p>What we need instead is a positive movement towards what truly motivates 

        us in all areas of our lives. What is it that makes us feel expansive? 

        makes us feel alive? warm? self-confident? and eager? What stimulates 

        us? What makes us catch fire with excitement, enthusiasm and exuberance? 

        What brings joy into our lives with a spark of creative power? What is 

        it that says &quot;Yes!&quot; to all of this?</p>

      <p>If we were living in India our answer might be Shakti, the goddess whose 

        Kundalini energy moves from the base of the spine upwards in a fiery radiance. 

        Here in the West we might say it's Aphrodite. Whether east or west, it 

        is our energy in response to life. This energy is related to libido, but 

        in a much less genitally understood way. Of course, we can be passionately 

        in love or in lust, and that will pull us towards our beloved in sexual 

        attraction. But we can be passionately attracted to many other things 

        as well. Libido, as Freud understood it, was energy, most often sexual 

        energy, but nonetheless, it was the primordial fount of instincts, passions 

        and desires that propels human beings outward towards other objects and 

        other individuals. Essentially this energy is desire striving towards 

        union, towards connection. </p>

      <p>The person who writes most eloquently about all of this is Audre Lorde. 

        In her article &quot;The Erotic as Power,&quot; she evokes the erotic 

        as only a great poet can. For Lorde, the erotic is not a minor power, 

        but the basis for living fully. Just as the Greeks shunted Eros off as 

        a subsidiary son of Aphrodite, so we tend to see eros in restricted, sexually 

        explicit ways. Not so Audre Lorde. For her, the erotic is the life-affirming 

        power that arises from our deepest knowing and our deepest longing. It 

        is the creative energy that nurtures our connection to the allness of 

        life, to the interdependent web of all existence, the power that fosters 

        our fearless capacity for joy. In the presence of the erotic, we say &quot;yes&quot; 

        to our deepest cravings. </p>

      <p>In using the term &quot;craving,&quot; Lorde not only affirms our desires, 

        but underscores the physicality of those wishes, for cravings are physical 

        needs that urgently want to be quenched, appetites that call out to be 

        gratified. Early in the 21st century, we talk about cravings almost exclusively 

        in negative terms. We are supposed to blunt our cravings, certainly not 

        give in to them, perhaps even repress them altogether. In fact, the arena 

        that uses this word the most is the dieting industry. When I looked at 

        the history of the word craving, I was shocked to discover that it comes 

        from the same root as the German word &quot;Kraft,&quot; meaning power, 

        strength or might. In fact, in the Old English, it meant &quot;to demand 

        as a right.&quot; In modern English this same root gave rise to the word 

        &quot;to craft,&quot; meaning to make with skill, artistry and precision. 

        So if we take this etymology seriously, we can see that to deny our deepest 

        cravings is to deny ourselves our strength, our power and our creativity. 

      </p>

      <p>And that is exactly what Audre Lorde says, that self-abnegation, denying 

        ourselves, leads to suffering and a numbness that we all too often accept 

        as our lot. That instead we need to sharpen our senses with the electrical 

        charge that eros, that Aphrodite, or even more all-inclusively that Inanna 

        has to offer us and to delve into our deepest cravings, our deepest longings, 

        our most profound desires. If we do this, we will heighten and sensitize 

        and strengthen our experience, because we will have discovered our most 

        profoundly creative source.</p>

      <p>I agree with Audre Lorde. Instead of the kind of adolescent wallowing 

        that comes with rebellion against our former strictures, what we saw during 

        the &quot;sexual revolution,&quot; what we need is to delve into our deepest 

        longings, taking the risks that come along with them and letting our passions 

        fly. Then we can ask with Susan Griffin (another of my favorite poets), 

        &quot;Do you know how...wanting lets your eyes pierce space? How a resolve 

        to act can traverse this atmosphere as quick as light?....Despite the 

        threat of fire and our fear of the flames, we burst out through the roofs 

        of our houses. Desire is a force inside us. Our mouths drop open in the 

        rushing air. Our bodies float among stars. And we laugh in ecstasy to 

        know the air has wishes.....&quot;Yes,&quot; we call, full of ourselves 

        and delight, &quot;Yes,&quot; we sing, &quot;We fly through the night.&quot;</p>
