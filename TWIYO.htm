        <h1>CONNECT with your INNER WISDOM<br /> And RECEIVE the GUIDANCE you NEED</h1>


        <aside>Divination is the quest to understand more about the past, present, and future. In other words, … [oracles] are an
            attempt to understand ourselves better and discover how we might live better in the future.” -- Theresa Cheung.

        <aside>“Nancy Vedder-Shults has given us all a gift in this wonderfully clear and useful guide to learning how to listen
            to signals from your body, read your internal compass, and assess the wisdom within. At once practical and evocative,
            each divination invites you into awe and wonder.” — Camille Maurine and Lorin Roche, Meditation Secrets for Women</aside>

            <h3>The Whisperings of Intuition</h3>

            <p><b>Life today is full of noise.</b> We’re all bombarded by advertising messages, expert advice, campaign promises,
                and opinions of every sort. Sometimes it’s hard to hear yourself think.</p>

            <p>To make successful decisions for your highest good, you need to listen to what <b>Steve Jobs</b> called <b>“the whisperings” of intuition.</b></p>

            <p>The oracular techniques in <i>The World Is Your Oracle</i> will quiet the clammer in your head, so you can</p>

            <ul>
                <li>hear those “whisperings” from your inner wisdom</li>
                <li>see with your second sight, and</li>
                <li>connect with your body wisdom.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Everyone has questions</h3>

            <p>Everyone has burning questions. Everyone wants to find the answers. And everyone needs to know their own truth.
                But not everyone discovers this truth in the same way.</p>

            <p>Nancy has gathered together dozens of techniques from a wide variety of traditions, from basic to advanced. As
                a result, The World is Your Oracle offers a multicultural, multi-technique approach designed for each individual's
                unique situation, desire, and intuitive style. It helps you craft your own questions, delve into your inner
                knowing, and interpret the answers you receive. It harnesses the power of ancient divinatory methods so you
                can find answers to your modern questions.</p>

            <h3>ENERGIZE your INTUITION like the great ARTISTS, SCIENTISTS, and ENTREPENEURS of yesterday and today</h3>


            <h3>Oracles for “Outside-the-Box” Thinking</h3>

            <p>From ancient Greeks to modern-day North Americans, people all over the globe have gained insight into many questions
                by using oracles. That’s because divination can help you set priorities, meet challenges, and find creative
                solutions to your problems. </p>

            <p>Today we’re living in an environment of rapid change, where analytical thinking no longer suffices. As a result,
                in the last few years, a growing number of seekers have been turning to divination for spiritual sustenance.
                Even top executives have identified “creative insights” (i.e. oracles) as the best way forward in today’s
                market.

            <h3>DISCOVER your INNATE ABILITY to KNOW</h3>


            <p>Unlike other types of divination, which offer generic feedback, the oracles in this book show you how to channel
                our own abilities and tune into the messages surrounding you for specific guidance to your most pressing
                issues. It’s your receptivity to the truths buried in your unconscious that unlocks these divinations. You
                don’t have to believe in angels and spirit guides to use them.</p>

            <p>Instead The World is Your Oracle encourages spiritual development by connecting you to your deepest wisdom. Once
                you begin to put oracular insights into practice you’re on the path to authentic personal growth.</p>

                    to facilitate “aha moments,” those creative insights that seem to come to us spontaneously.</li>

                    exactly the frame of mind that divination facilitates – an altered state that seers and sages have known
                    about for millenia.

            <h3>How to perform the oracle you choose</h3>


            <h3>40 Techniques to Choose from</h3>

            <p>The World is Your Oracle provides historical and personal context and clear, step-by-step instructions for each
                of its 40 different oracular methods (1/3 visual, 1/3 auditory, and 1/3 kinesthetic). Together they offer
                many new ways of asking, answering, and understanding.</p>

            <p>And you don’t have to go far. Oracles are part of the natural world that surrounds us. You can:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Get guidance from the wild as you notice what animals cross your path</li>
                <li>Enter the wisdom of the spirit world by calling upon your guides and ancestors</li>
                <li>Prime yourself to dream about your question and awaken to a solution</li>
                <li>Let repeated cues and coincidences clue you into a new perspective</li>
                <li>Take a Zen Concentration Walk to mindfully reflect on the issue at hand</li>
                <li>Tap into your body’s hidden wisdom to get insight and answers</li>

            <h3>How to increase your creativity and tune into your inner wisdom.</h3>

            <p>Oracles Also Help in Your Day-to-Day Life</p>

            <p>Oracles put you in touch with yourself. They let you discover your motivations, feelings, and thoughts about
                any question you’re exploring.</p>

            <p>Divination can help you set priorities, meet challenges, and find creative solutions to your problems. At times,
                oracles can even point to an outworn habit that you need to discard, or encourage you to take a risk that
                you might have been too timid to tackle on your own.</p>

            <p>But most importantly, they can help you in your daily life to stay happy and healthy. And you can tap into your
                inner knowing whenever you need it.</p>
