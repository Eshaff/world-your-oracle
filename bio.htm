      /> My work is rooted in ritual, story and song as well as in feminist thealogy and women's studies scholarship.
      As a Ph.D., I honed my skills in the emerging field of Women's Studies in the 1970s and 1980s, evolving an empowering
      leadership and teaching style that I use in my retreats and workshops today. I believe that my ongoing research in
      divination and myth is accessible and inviting. (And that my workshops are playful and fun!) <br>

      <br> I've offered personal growth workshops since 1987. In 1992, I left the Women's Studies Program at the University
      of Wisconsin-Madison to work full-time as a singer, storyteller, educator, workshop facilitator and ritualist. Since
      then I've presented workshops and sung all over North America, as well as writing <a href="oracle.htm"><b>The World is Your Oracle.</b></a>
      My approach is both creative and intellectual, using the skills that created my recording <b>Chants for the Queen of 
      Heaven</b> as well as those that led to my Ph.D. <br>

      <br> My efforts recently received recognition when I was named a Wisdom Keeper of the Goddess Spirituality Movement, 
      and in the form of a Feminist Theology Award from the Unitarian Universalist Women's Federation. <br>

      <br> I live in Madison, WI, with a feminist spouse. My self-empowered, thirty-something daughter created the beautiful illustrations for <b>The World is Your Oracle</b>.
