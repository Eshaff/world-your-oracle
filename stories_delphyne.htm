        <span class="smallheadline1">DELPHYNE'S TALE: EARTH MEETS SKY by Nancy 

        Vedder-Shults (to be published in Sophia: Journal of Women and Religion 

        in Spring, 2002)</span> <br>

        <br>

        Long before Apollo there was Gaia, our Mother Earth. And long before the 

        ancient temples were erected at Delphi, there was a simple cave guarded 

        by a snake. This is the story of that snake, Delphyne, Gaia's serpent 

        daughter. It is a story of sun and shadow, of appearances and disappearances, 

        a story of life's sacred mysteries and earth's many blessings.<br>

        <br>

        The first blessing, of course, was Gaia herself, she who birthed us smelling 

        of breast milk and soil just ploughed. Since the beginning she has nurtured 

        us from her black furrows. And when we die, she welcomes us once again 

        into her rich earth. Life -- death -- rebirth. This is what Gaia brought 

        her people, the unending blessings of darkness and light, the cycles of 

        day and night, the seasons of the year, the mysteries of the earth.<br>

        <br>

        These were celebrated in a cave at Delphi. Here the people marked the 

        spot where Gaia gave birth to the world and everything upon it, declaring 

        Delphi the womb of the universe. And here the people returned to listen 

        to Delphyne, Gaia's oracle. For Gaia had fashioned her serpent daughter 

        to protect her sacred mysteries and to prophesy for those who approached 

        the Earth Mother with respect and reverence. Intoxicating vapors escaped 

        from fissures inside the holy cave, hissing Delphyne's sibilant omens 

        and announcing Gaia's will to those who journeyed here.<br>

        <br>

        For the Earth Mother had created Delphyne in her own image. The serpent, 

        like her mother's cycles of day and night, appeared and disappeared, sometimes 

        slithering upon the sunny surface of the earth and sometimes burrowing 

        into its darkest depths. When she became too large, she sloughed her worn-out 

        skin, embracing the freedom of surrender and release. And once she had 

        shed her outer layer, she renewed herself, manifesting the wisdom of Gaia's 

        healing and rebirth. Life -- death -- rebirth. This was the mystery of 

        the snake as it was of her mother.<br>

        <br>

        But the people forgot these mysteries and began to fashion new gods for 

        themselves, gods in their own image, dressed in human form. Zeus, Ares, 

        Apollo, gods of the heavens, not of the earth, gods of the sun, not of 

        the shade, gods who dwelt on the highest peaks, not everywhere as Mother 

        Gaia before them. These heavenly beings were filled with arrogance and 

        jealousy, the arrogance of immortality and the jealousy of dominance. 

        Zeus declared himself supreme and thought to parcel out the heavens and 

        the earth to the gods who ruled with him. To his son Apollo he gave the 

        task of conquering Delphi. But who can vanquish the seat of life-death-and-rebirth? 

        How can you attack the cycle of the seasons, the pattern of day and night? 

        Where is the beginning of a circle?<br>

        <br>

        Such questions did not daunt Apollo. He was a new god, a young god, a 

        god of utmost hubris. Delphi would be his, he thought to himself. If anyone 

        wanted an oracle from the gods, any of the gods, they would have to go 

        through him; he would be their intermediary. He believed this would bring 

        order to Gaia's chaotic omens. And in his mind he saw glistening marble 

        temples with classical proportions, priests garbed in togas restraining 

        the thronging pilgrims and a fence enclosing the holy spring. And in his 

        imagination, he heard music played on flute and lyre, harmonious in form 

        and structure. He envisioned himself taming the Muses and bringing them 

        to Mt. Parnassus at Delphi. Such was Apollo's hubris, to think that he 

        could domesticate the fount of creativity! So in his pride he fashioned 

        himself a bow and went to Delphi as a conqueror.<br>

        <br>

        When Delphyne saw him approach, bow and arrow in hand, the air rasped 

        in her throat, a guttural sound that traveled the length of her spine 

        and back, finally hissing through her lips.<br>

        <br>

        "Such audacity," she thought to herself. "Such ignorance! He does not 

        know who stands before him."<br>

        <br>

        And when Apollo demanded her submission, Delphyne laughed out loud, a 

        roar that echoed off the mountain peaks surrounding Delphi, carrying flames 

        high into the sky.<br>

        <br>

        "Gaia's daughter does not engage in combat," she said, looking him in 

        the eye. "And Gaia's daughter knows no defeat. Aim well and true, young 

        godling. Shoot your arrow into my very heart, but know that when you are 

        done and see my carcass lying at your feet, I will be with you still."<br>

        <br>

        For Delphyne knew that although she was mortal, she would be reborn, just 

        we exhale in order to take in fresh air.<br>

        <br>

        So Apollo took up the challenge and slapped the arrow against his bow, 

        drew the cord and let fly, straight into the dragon's heart. And Delphyne 

        collapsed in front of her cave, a mountain of flesh coiled in upon itself. 

        Apollo left the carcass to decay where it had dropped, focussing the heat 

        of the sun upon it. And from its rotten stench he renamed the dragon Python, 

        the decomposed one. But he never noticed that among the worms that wound 

        their way through the dragon's remains, was a tiny snake that slithered 

        off into the sacred cave, Delphyne reborn.<br>

        <br>

        After Delphyne's death and rebirth, the pilgrims came as they had before. 

        Now to be sure, there were temples and pomp, priests in their regalia 

        as the people waited in single file to speak with the woman Apollo had 

        appointed as his priestess. But this young woman breathed in the sacred 

        fumes from the earth and listened to the hiss of Delphyne as of yore. 

        For you see without Gaia there is no life, there is no death, there is 

        no rebirth. And without Delphyne there is no oracle. And though Apollo 

        may march and strut, parading as the god of Delphi, his mother and the 

        mother of us all continues her cycle of life -- death -- and rebirth. 

        Stars blink in and out of existence. The snake renews itself and is reborn.<br>

        <br>

        Delphyne, Gaia's child, come and live in me. Delphyne, Gaia's child, I'll 

        be cave to Thee. Serpent of the shadow, The mystery you know, Delphyne, 

        Gaia's child, in you I ebb and flow. <br>
