        Vedder-Shults (to be published in Sophia: Journal of Women and Religion 
        in Spring, 2002)</span> <br>
        <br>
        Long before Apollo there was Gaia, our Mother Earth. And long before the 
        ancient temples were erected at Delphi, there was a simple cave guarded 
        by a snake. This is the story of that snake, Delphyne, Gaia's serpent 
        daughter. It is a story of sun and shadow, of appearances and disappearances, 
        a story of life's sacred mysteries and earth's many blessings.<br>
        <br>
        The first blessing, of course, was Gaia herself, she who birthed us smelling 
        of breast milk and soil just ploughed. Since the beginning she has nurtured 
        us from her black furrows. And when we die, she welcomes us once again 
        into her rich earth. Life -- death -- rebirth. This is what Gaia brought 
        her people, the unending blessings of darkness and light, the cycles of 
        day and night, the seasons of the year, the mysteries of the earth.<br>
        <br>
        These were celebrated in a cave at Delphi. Here the people marked the 
        spot where Gaia gave birth to the world and everything upon it, declaring 
        Delphi the womb of the universe. And here the people returned to listen 
        to Delphyne, Gaia's oracle. For Gaia had fashioned her serpent daughter 
        to protect her sacred mysteries and to prophesy for those who approached 
        the Earth Mother with respect and reverence. Intoxicating vapors escaped 
        from fissures inside the holy cave, hissing Delphyne's sibilant omens 
        and announcing Gaia's will to those who journeyed here.<br>
        <br>
        For the Earth Mother had created Delphyne in her own image. The serpent, 
        like her mother's cycles of day and night, appeared and disappeared, sometimes 
        slithering upon the sunny surface of the earth and sometimes burrowing 
        into its darkest depths. When she became too large, she sloughed her worn-out 
        skin, embracing the freedom of surrender and release. And once she had 
        shed her outer layer, she renewed herself, manifesting the wisdom of Gaia's 
        healing and rebirth. Life -- death -- rebirth. This was the mystery of 
        the snake as it was of her mother.<br>
        <br>
        But the people forgot these mysteries and began to fashion new gods for 
        themselves, gods in their own image, dressed in human form. Zeus, Ares, 
        Apollo, gods of the heavens, not of the earth, gods of the sun, not of 
        the shade, gods who dwelt on the highest peaks, not everywhere as Mother 
        Gaia before them. These heavenly beings were filled with arrogance and 
        jealousy, the arrogance of immortality and the jealousy of dominance. 
        Zeus declared himself supreme and thought to parcel out the heavens and 
        the earth to the gods who ruled with him. To his son Apollo he gave the 
        task of conquering Delphi. But who can vanquish the seat of life-death-and-rebirth? 
        How can you attack the cycle of the seasons, the pattern of day and night? 
        Where is the beginning of a circle?<br>
        <br>
        Such questions did not daunt Apollo. He was a new god, a young god, a 
        god of utmost hubris. Delphi would be his, he thought to himself. If anyone 
        wanted an oracle from the gods, any of the gods, they would have to go 
        through him; he would be their intermediary. He believed this would bring 
        order to Gaia's chaotic omens. And in his mind he saw glistening marble 
        temples with classical proportions, priests garbed in togas restraining 
        the thronging pilgrims and a fence enclosing the holy spring. And in his 
        imagination, he heard music played on flute and lyre, harmonious in form 
        and structure. He envisioned himself taming the Muses and bringing them 
        to Mt. Parnassus at Delphi. Such was Apollo's hubris, to think that he 
        could domesticate the fount of creativity! So in his pride he fashioned 
        himself a bow and went to Delphi as a conqueror.<br>
        <br>
        When Delphyne saw him approach, bow and arrow in hand, the air rasped 
        in her throat, a guttural sound that traveled the length of her spine 
        and back, finally hissing through her lips.<br>
        <br>
        "Such audacity," she thought to herself. "Such ignorance! He does not 
        know who stands before him."<br>
        <br>
        And when Apollo demanded her submission, Delphyne laughed out loud, a 
        roar that echoed off the mountain peaks surrounding Delphi, carrying flames 
        high into the sky.<br>
        <br>
        "Gaia's daughter does not engage in combat," she said, looking him in 
        the eye. "And Gaia's daughter knows no defeat. Aim well and true, young 
        godling. Shoot your arrow into my very heart, but know that when you are 
        done and see my carcass lying at your feet, I will be with you still."<br>
        <br>
        For Delphyne knew that although she was mortal, she would be reborn, just 
        we exhale in order to take in fresh air.<br>
        <br>
        So Apollo took up the challenge and slapped the arrow against his bow, 
        drew the cord and let fly, straight into the dragon's heart. And Delphyne 
        collapsed in front of her cave, a mountain of flesh coiled in upon itself. 
        Apollo left the carcass to decay where it had dropped, focussing the heat 
        of the sun upon it. And from its rotten stench he renamed the dragon Python, 
        the decomposed one. But he never noticed that among the worms that wound 
        their way through the dragon's remains, was a tiny snake that slithered 
        off into the sacred cave, Delphyne reborn.<br>
        <br>
        After Delphyne's death and rebirth, the pilgrims came as they had before. 
        Now to be sure, there were temples and pomp, priests in their regalia 
        as the people waited in single file to speak with the woman Apollo had 
        appointed as his priestess. But this young woman breathed in the sacred 
        fumes from the earth and listened to the hiss of Delphyne as of yore. 
        For you see without Gaia there is no life, there is no death, there is 
        no rebirth. And without Delphyne there is no oracle. And though Apollo 
        may march and strut, parading as the god of Delphi, his mother and the 
        mother of us all continues her cycle of life -- death -- and rebirth. 
        Stars blink in and out of existence. The snake renews itself and is reborn.<br>
        <br>
        Delphyne, Gaia's child, come and live in me. Delphyne, Gaia's child, I'll 
        be cave to Thee. Serpent of the shadow, The mystery you know, Delphyne, 
        Gaia's child, in you I ebb and flow. <br>
