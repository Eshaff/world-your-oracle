        recording
        <A HREF="music.htm">Chants</A> in 1993, I've traveled all over North America, facilitating workshops and retreats, delivering keynotes, creating
        worship services and singing. In the first year alone I flew to Southern California, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Saskatchewan,
        Canada, Michigan, Missouri and many cities in the Upper Midwest. Since then I've flown all over the US, from north
        to south and from east to west.
        <br>

        <br> I guess I'm a born teacher and performer, because I'll walk more than a mile and fly many hundreds to create
        learning experiences that include music, movement, and the kind of work and play that allows people to take the next
        step in their personal growth. I've performed weddings and memorial services, worked with children, led many worship
        services and rituals, and everywhere I go, I sing my music. I work a great deal with Unitarian Universalists, since 
        that's my religious home, but I've also presented workshops for people in earth-centered traditions, for Religious 
        Scientists, for Unity Church and for interfaith groups. My ecofeminism speaks to many people. What I have to say 
        seems to resonate with seekers, and there are a lot of us today.

            <br>

            <span class="smallheadline1">The World is Your Oracle</span>
            <br> Divination allows you to discover your inner wisdom and connect with its counsel. From Nancy's new book
            of the same name.

            <p align="left"><span class="smallheadline1">Mythic Modes </span>
              <br> Utilizing intellectual, physical, creative and ritual modes, make the sacred stories that undergird your
              life visible while connecting consciously with your deepest concerns and your truest self.

              <p align="left"><span class="smallheadline1">Invoking the Fire Dragon </span>
                <br> Invoke the fire dragon and usher eros into your life, infusing yourself with the playful energy that
                is the source for ecstatic movement, sensuality and pleasure.
                <br>

                <br>

                <span class="smallheadline1">Reclaiming Our Stories, Reclaiming Ourselves 

        </span>
                <br> Empower your story through personal mythmaking and multicultural tales. While the hero's quest is validated
                in our culture, other stories are trivialized. We need the wisdom of each person's life history.
                <br>

                <br>

                <span class="smallheadline1">Honoring Each Other, Honoring Ourselves </span>
                <br> An anti-racism workshop focusing on intercultural understanding, discovering our deep connections and
                celebrating our diversity.

                <br>

                <span class="smallheadline1">Dream Wisdom </span>
                <br> Beginning with a dream incubation, we interpret dreams with role-playing, dialoging, ritual, Gestalt,
                etc.
                <br>

                <br>

                <span class="smallheadline1">A Council of All Beings </span>
                <br> In this communal ritual, we set aside our human identity in order to speak on behalf of other life-forms
                on our beautiful, but threatened earth.

                <br>

                <br>

        and Song </span>
                <br> An interactive lecture honoring goddesses from several traditions. We've come to know why women need

                <br>

                <span class="smallheadline1">Balancing Dark & Light </span>
                <br> Look inward for your own fertile darkness and the light which illuminates it. The dark is shunned in
                our culture, but dark earth energies are at the core of all creativity.
                <br>

                <br>

                <br>

                <br>

                <span class="smallheadline1">Seasonal Rituals </span>
