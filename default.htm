    Hello World!
    <h1 class="page-title">Mama's Minstrel</h1>

    <img src="images/nancymug_home_08232017.jpg" class="image-large" alt="Nancy Vedder-Shults">
    <div class="wrap-image">
      <img src="images/M_busorama_35_ochre_letter.jpg" width="27" height="29" alt="M">ama's Minstrel? Gaia's Grrrl? These
      were the two names I thought of calling this website. You might guess from these monikers that I love the Earth. And
      you'd be right. I see Her as sacred. You might also guess that I'm a feminist. I believe that all people should be
      equal, and I've worked for years to make equality a fact. You might finally guess that I'm a musician. Actually you
      can figure that out just by reading the banner above. I honor Gaia with stories, songs and sacred play. <br>

      <br> If I step back to allow an overview of my work, what I see is that I want to <b><i>Awaken a Creative Vision</i></b>.
      I want to inspire new ways of seeing and hearing so that together we can transform the false polarities of our culture
      and create a more holistic and compassionate understanding of the world. I want to awaken a creative vision that connects
      and reconnects us to the earth, to each other and to the many ways of knowing ourselves and our Mother Gaia.<br>

      <br> Through play? Through stories? Through song? Aren't these the tools of a child? Yes, exactly. I believe that we
      tap into our deepest selves through spontaneity, humor, fantasy and a sense of wonder, all childlike qualities. From
      the inner wisdom of our deeper selves -- accessed through stories, songs and sacred play -- we create the visions we
      need of a just, earth-loving, sustainable future. <br>

    <ul type="square">
      <li>Fair Winds Press published my book <i><a href="oracle.htm">The World is Your Oracle: Divinatory Practices for Tapping Your Inner Wisdom and 
        Getting the Answers You Need</a></i> last April.</li>
      <li>I'm writing a book called <a href="embracing.htm">The Hero's Demise</a>, which includes 7 retold dragon myths (in progress).
      </li>
      <li>I use <a href="writings.htm">stories</a> as the basis of my workshops.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="heading_one">I honor Gaia with SACRED PLAY</h1>

    <ul type="square">
      <li>I'm creating a divination deck &#151; called <a href="writings.htm"><i>The World is Your Oracle</i></a> &#151; that
        includes 52 oracular techniques.</li>
      <li>My <a href="workshops.htm">workshops and retreats</a> are really PLAYSHOPS, utilizing ALL of us -- our hearts, minds,
        body and spirit -- to discover our deepest wisdom and the next step on our spiritual paths.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="heading_one">I honor Gaia with SONG</h1>

    <ul type="square">
      <li>I recorded <a href="music.htm#chants">Chants for the Queen of Heaven</a>, a tape of goddess chants from around the
        world with a 9-woman singing group and a dozen ethnomusicians.</li>
      <li>I recorded <a href="music.htm#singing">Singing the Promise</a>, a live CD with 3 other pagan musicians.</li>

          Gaia, you who unite earth, air, fire and water <br> 
          on this beautiful blue-green orb, <br>
          Mother of us all, bless us today! <br>
          You who birthed the two-leggeds and the four-leggeds, <br> 
          the creeping animals and those who swim and fly, <br> 
          Remind us that we are one with all our relations <br> 
          as we live our lives today. <br> 
          Come through us in human flesh, <br> 
          in all we touch and feel. <br> 
          You who are literally the ground of our being, <br> 
          the source of our life and our welfare, <br> 
          Root in our center until we live <br> 
          as moving trees on your surface. <br> 
          Reunite us, we who so often feel separate and alone, <br> 
          with our brothers and sisters, <br> 
          the animals, the plants, the mountains, the clouds, <br> 
          and all of humanity <br> 
          As we bring a new world to birth. <br> 
          O Mother Gaia, we welcome your presence. <br> 
          Blessed be!
