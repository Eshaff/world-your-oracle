        Gaia Through Other Writings</b></p>

        <p align="left">Some people say that our society is poor in stories, that television and movies have replaced the storytelling traditions
          of our ancestors. When it comes to folk tales or other time-honored stories, these people are probably right. But
          story will never die as long as there are two people left on earth. Just listen at your next party. <br>

          <br> We tell stories, because the meaning of our lives is revealed in the tales we tell. We tell stories to entertain
          and to forge connections with others. We tell stories to teach, to transmit our culture to others. And we tell
          stories to mark the significance of events. In our personal stories we each become the protagonist, the main character
          who navigates the waters of life. We see ourselves acting in the world with a particular sense of self. And the
          more we act, the more stories we create. <br>

          <br> Nowhere can we feel the cultural weight of story as we can in myths and other religious tales. More than any
          other type of story, myth orients us to the major sources of meaning in our lives. It instructs us in how we are
          supposed to relate to nature, to ourselves, to others and even to the sacred itself. These are the "great stories"
          we live by, even if we haven't taken conscious note of them. They create the archetypes or patterns we embrace
          as blueprints for how to live our lives. The symbols we find in myths can open us to depths of reality that are
          often closed to us. They can express intuitive insights that relate our lives to something bigger than ourselves,
          something deeper, something relevant to more than our individual lives. As a result, myth can aid us in living.
