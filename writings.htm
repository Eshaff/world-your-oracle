        <span class="heading_one">Forthcoming Book: The World is Your Oracle</span> 
      <p align="left"> <img src="ancestors.gif" width="285" height="222" align="left">I 
        come from a noisy family. My father was half-deaf, so we learned to speak 
        loudly in order to be heard. All six of us &#150; my father, mother, three 
        sisters and I &#150; sang trios or quartets in the car while traveling, 
        with the youngest kids doubling up on the melody. And at supper the child 
        who jumped fastest with the most volume often took over the conversation. 
        As a result, years went by before I discovered that &#147;the secret power 
        of my song was in its silence.&#148; 
      <p>As a professional singer, I incorporated this wisdom into my music well 
        before I understood its full implications. In the last decade and a half, 
        I have learned that stillness &#151; whether it&#146;s the silence needed 
        for inhaling or the rests between the notes &#151; not only energizes 
        my music, but in a larger sense, can also open a space for greater understanding. 
        If I still my voice and then my thoughts, I can listen to my intuition. 
      <p> </p>
      <p>But in a world where I am bombarded with visual and auditory stimuli, 
        I can&#146;t always stop the noise to access my inner wisdom. Besides 
        I don&#146;t always remember to listen for the insight contained in the 
        stillness within. In order to remind myself to check in on a regular basis, 
        I began to look for ways to tap into the deeper layers of my mind. The 
        result is <i>The World is Your Oracle</i>, a compilation of hundreds of 
        divination methods, from ancient oracles to modern-day techniques. The 
        excerpts published here will describe a few ways to access the deeper 
        layers of our minds and broaden our perceptions.</p>
      <p>In North America most of us associate divination with the occult. Traditionally 
        the concept conjures up the image of an old gypsy woman using her deck 
        of playing cards to tell someone&#146;s fortune. From my perspective, 
        this is an archaic (and stereotypical) understanding of oracles, one created 
        during a time when we drew sharper distinctions between the everyday and 
        the mysterious, the natural and the supernatural, between rationality 
        and non-rational ways of knowing, and even between the past and the future. 
        In my life, I&#146;ve often found the mysterious in the midst of the everyday 
        and the supernatural within the natural; I&#146;ve used both rational 
        and intuitive practices to discover my own wisdom; and I&#146;ve noticed 
        that the future is often contained in the present moment, however embryonically. 
        As a result, instead of occult fortunetelling of future events, I define 
        divination as the active use of my intuition, employing a variety of methods 
        for getting in touch with my inner knowing.</p>
      <p>Over the years I&#146;ve learned that a good oracle puts me in touch 
        with myself. It lets me discover my motivations, feelings and thoughts 
        about the question I&#146;m exploring. And it connects me with the atmosphere 
        or environment surrounding that question, making me aware of the water 
        I swim in, but usually don&#146;t notice.</p>
      <p>To receive inner guidance, all I need is to open myself to what my body/mind 
        tells me, what my emotions display and what my unconscious knows. In this 
        way, I can begin to hear with my inner ears and see with my inner eyes. 
        Using these mystical senses &#151; what you might call the sense organs 
        of the unconscious &#151; I perceive holistically, noticing relationships 
        and patterns rather than isolating, classifying and judging what I see 
        and hear. Once I&#146;ve gathered this wisdom, I can then use my rational 
        mind to interpret what I&#146;ve learned.</p>
      <p>We live in an interconnected world, a web of life. Each segment of that 
        web reflects the whole just like fractal designs or holography. That&#146;s 
        why the patterns that we discover through divination give us information. 
        They mimic the relationships of the whole at a particular moment in time.

      <p><b><img src="dragon_ornate1_texture_a-opt.jpg" width="272" height="266" align="left">Honoring 
        Gaia Through Other Writings</b></p>
      <p align="left">Some people say that our society is poor in stories, that 
        television and movies have replaced the storytelling traditions of our 
        ancestors. When it comes to folk tales or other time-honored stories, 
        these people are probably right. But story will never die as long as there 
        are two people left on earth. Just listen at your next party. <br>
        <br>
        We tell stories, because the meaning of our lives is revealed in the tales 
        we tell. We tell stories to entertain and to forge connections with others. 
        We tell stories to teach, to transmit our culture to others. And we tell 
        stories to mark the significance of events. In our personal stories we 
        each become the protagonist, the main character who navigates the waters 
        of life. We see ourselves acting in the world with a particular sense 
        of self. And the more we act, the more stories we create. <br>
        <br>
        Nowhere can we feel the cultural weight of story as we can in myths and 
        other religious tales. More than any other type of story, myth orients 
        us to the major sources of meaning in our lives. It instructs us in how 
        we are supposed to relate to nature, to ourselves, to others and even 
        to the sacred itself. These are the "great stories" we live by, even if 
        we haven't taken conscious note of them. They create the archetypes or 
        patterns we embrace as blueprints for how to live our lives. The symbols 
        we find in myths can open us to depths of reality that are often closed 
        to us. They can express intuitive insights that relate our lives to something 
        bigger than ourselves, something deeper, something relevant to more than 
        our individual lives. As a result, myth can aid us in living. <br>
