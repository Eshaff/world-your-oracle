After eliciting questions that need answers, we will invite our inner wisdom to respond.  As opposed to the pre-programmed answers provided by Tarot, the I Ching, or runes, the techniques we will investigate employ the three major intuitive senses: the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.  Such embodied oracles help us to turn inward in order to develop deep listening, deep vision, and deep sensing of our flashes of insight. Opening to our inner depths in this way allows us to set priorities, meet challenges, and find creative solutions.  Such practices can strengthen us in our insight, determination, and courage, empowering us on our spiritual paths as well as in our daily life. This class is an ideal introduction for those who are just beginning to perform oracles as well as an opportunity for those experienced with divination to find fresh inspiration. Come and sink deeply into your inner knowing, fine-tune your life’s trajectory, and renew your connection with Spirit. Week 1 of a 4-week series. $100, if prepaid before April 14. $120 at the door.
