        <b>Chants for the Queen of Heaven...and Earth</b> is a new cassette recording 

        of ritual chants by Madison artist Nancy Vedder-Shults and friends. A 

        beautiful and inspiring mixture of original melodies and traditional songs 

        from Tibet, India, Cuba, Hawaii, Korea, South Africa and the United States, 

        this tape is an important contribution to the growing musical genre of 

        women's spirituality. <br>

        <br>

        <b><img src="images/Snake-opt.jpg" width="122" height="372" align="left"></b>Recorded 

        live at the Unitarian church here in Madison, with seed money from a Unitarian 

        Universalist Women's Federation Feminist Theology Award, "Chants" features 

        Nancy's rich voice and skilled arrangements. No less important are the 

        talented singers and musicians who accompany her. Normajean Bunton, Barbara 

        Burdulis, Suzanne Christensen, Maggie Delaney-Potthof, Lynn Fendler, Jade, 

        Judith Lary, Paula Murphy, Mary Sykes and Barbara Vedder are the singers; 

        ethnomusicians include Atma on drums, Rolliana Scheckler on harp, Marianne 

        Egerstrand on talking drum, Marcel Colbert on agogo, Anne Fraioli on flute, 

        Cathy Moore on hurdy gurdy, Jennifer Morgan on English horn, Marianne 

        Westphal on cello, Eva Wright on chimes, Jim Yocky on drums and Tibetan 

        bell and Ranjitas Gupta on tabla.<br>

        <br>

        Nancy Vedder-Shults has been collecting chants and sacred songs for years, 

        learning them at women's festivals, conferences and concerts, and researching 

        them in books and music libraries. She has been involved with the Women 

        and Religion Committee of the Unitarian Universalist Associations' Central 

        Midwest District, and wrote an annotated discography for the Womanspirit 

        Sourcebook five years ago. Through these experiences, she says, she realized 

        "how little excellent chant music was available" for use in women's rituals, 

        and was inspired to contribute her own work. <br>

        <br>

        Reclaiming beautiful and powerful images of women is an essential component 

        of feminism. Traditional goddess mythology is an important source of such 

        imagery, and Nancy's work brings to life female deities from many cultures. 

        "Amaterasu," with its haunting flute melody, is a tribute to the Japanese 

        Shinto Sun Goddess. Nancy adds that it is about "seeing your own beauty 

        and realizing the power of yourself as a woman -- and as a goddess." <br>

        <br>

        "Volcano Woman" celebrates the fiery creative power of the Hawaiian Goddess 

        Pele with a catchy beat that brings to mind a vision of women dancing 

        amidst leaping flames....Kwan Yin, Kali, Tara, Yemaya, Calliope, Sarasvati, 

        Spider Woman and Oshun are also invoked in chants ranging in mood from 

        meditative to exuberant. <br>

        <br>

        In addition to reclaiming goddesses and mythical heroines as strong and 

        powerful role models, many women have begun to embrace them as aspects 

        of the divine, or of an all-encompassing spiritual force. Chants which 

        invoke goddesses, ancestors, and the divine within each of us can be integral 

        to rituals of personal and spiritual transformation. I first heard Nancy's 

        "Old Crone of Mystery" in a ritual context where the participants sought 

        the wisdom of the Crone. Hearing the chant again is a vivid reminder of 

        that empowering event. <br>

        <br>

        The groups's rendition of "I Found God in Myself [and I loved Her fiercely]" 

        is one of my favorites on the tape, since it proclaims both the self-love 

        so important to a feminist consciousness, and the immanence of the deity, 

        one of the central tenets of goddess spirituality. <br>

        <br>

        The only song on the tape that I don't like is one of Nancy's solos, "Every 

        Hour;" it reminds me too much of the Sound of Music's "Climb Every Mountain;" 

        it, too, might work okay as the triumphant denouement of the movie after 

        the Trapp Family Singers' escape from the Nazis, but in this context I 

        found it boring. <br>

        <br>

        The final piece on the tape, "Ancestral Faces," is written by Adele Smith, 

        an African-American Unitarian Universalist woman. It is an incredibly 

        powerful invocation of the "women who have gone before us, who embody 

        the goddess...the historical truthseekers and mythical figures in African 

        and African-American culture." The litany of women who are honored in 

        this ritual piece is impressive and inspiring, and the rhythm is the foot-tapping, 

        blood-pumping kind. <br>

        <br>

        If you missed the release concert for this recording in June, you'll want 

        to pick up a copy soon. (It's available at A Room on One's Own Feminist 

        Bookstore). If you were one of the many who packed the First Unitarian 

        Society's Frank Lloyd Wright sanctuary for the concert, I probably don't 

        need to urge you to buy it! For ritual use or simply for listening pleasure, 

        Chants for the Queen of Heaven ...and Earth will be well worth your money.
