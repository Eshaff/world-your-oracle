        MOTHER by Nancy Vedder-Shults, Ph.D. (originally published in a slightly

      <br>

        <b>India Abundant to Excess</b><br>

        <br>When I visited India 

        nearly twenty years ago, I found it to be an overwhelming experience. 

        The streets were filled to overflowing with people, oxcarts, cars with 

        horns blaring, trucks inching along between pedestrians, camel carts, 

        bicycles and more people, food stalls, markets with vegetables and spices 

        I had never seen before and people on top of people. As a Westerner I 

        found all this lively interaction disconcerting, especially since it was 

        very difficult to find a time and place to be alone. Life -- even human 

        life -- was abundant to the point of excess.<br><br>But the same was true when 

        it came to death. I never realized how sheltered I had been from the sight 

        of death in the U.S. until I saw two dozen vultures and a half dozen dogs 

        fighting over the carcass of a dead cow. Life and death are florid in 

        their display in this country two-thirds the size of the U.S. with over 

        four times as many inhabitants. In such a country it is obvious that life 

        and death are intimately intertwined; Indians see their mutual effects 

        everyday. It seems short-sighted to them to focus, as we do, on life and 

        growth, ignoring death and decay. Hinduism acknowledges what is clear 

        to even a casual observer of the Indian landscape, that within a closed 

        ecosystem, death is a necessity if life is to continue. It shouldn't be 

        surprising then that Hindu art and mythology tend to stretch the limits 

        when depicting both the charms and terrors of life. India confronts the 

        mind's eye, as well as its bodily counterpart, with both the terrifying 

        and pleasing extremes of the sacred, a view that allows Hindus to discover 

        the all-encompassing nature of the divine. Every major Hindu god and goddess 

        represents the sacred as a "coincidence of opposites." The great deities 

        like Shiva, Vishnu and the Goddess, simultaneously encompass life and 

        death, good and evil, darkness and light, creation and destruction, demonstrating 

        the full spectrum of life, death and rebirth. Kali's Transformative Power 

        One of the best examples of this transformative power is the Indian goddess 

        Kali. As the goddess of life, death and rebirth, Kali is usually depicted 

        as a dark-faced, voracious cannibal dancing in the cremation grounds while 

        holding a sword, a severed head, a bowl of blood and a noose in her four 

        hands. Around her neck is a garland of skulls, the corpses of two children 

        hang from her ears, while her waistband is made up of bloody arms torn 

        from the shoulders of her victims. Often a living snake winds around her 

        body from one shoulder cross-wise to her opposite hip, replacing the sacred 

        thread traditionally worn by Brahmins. Her apparel frequently includes 

        other smaller snakes as armbands and bracelets.<br><br>She's not a pretty picture. 

        In fact, she's hard for most of us Americans to take. I can remember a 

        friend's first reaction to one of Kali's icons. We were both members of 

        a women's spirituality group, reading books about goddesses from prepartriarchal 

        times to the present. My friend shook h er head, looking away from the 

        picture of Kali I was holding, and laughing, asked what such a picture 

        could possibly mean. This educated peer was not only repulsed, but wanted 

        to get this experience quickly behind her. It was one thing to talk about 

        birth, death and rebirth in the abstract -- something we had been doing 

        for months --, but it was another thing entirely to see it represented 

        so starkly. The experience made me wonder if we North Americans fear the 

        depths of the sacred. Perhaps it is just that we have pushed questions 

        that pertain to death into the dark unknown of our consciousness.<br><br>In focussing 

        on Kali's deadly side, we in the U.S. tend to misrepresent and misunderstand 

        this goddess. For Kali is also the goddess who gives birth to the entire 

        universe, something we can see in her iconography as well. She dances 

        naked so that her fruitful yoni or vagina is obviously displayed as are 

        the full breasts with which she nourishes all she has brought into the 

        world. In fact, one of her best-known representations shows her straddling 

        the god Shiva, transforming him from a corpse into a lover, ready with 

        erect phallus to satisfy her unbridled desire. It is Kali who brings Shiva 

        back from the dead and gives him life, because she is Shakti, the inherent 

        energy in the universe, the force that activates what is potential and 

        creates the world.<br><br> Ramakrishna was one of the major poets who popularized 

        Kali's worship in Bengal, the easternmost province of India. Born in the 

        early part of the 19th century, he was a Hindu saint in a tradition known 

        as bhakti where devotees lovingly surrender their hearts, minds and spirits 

        to their chosen deity in a practice which leads to ecstatic union with 

        the divine. Such devotion is easy for us in the West to imagine when the 

        beloved is the playful Krishna with his sublime flute-playing and sacred 

        lovemaking. But in Ramakrishna's case, the object of his devotion was 

        the fierce Kali, the wild and uncontrollable aspects of the sacred, to 

        whom he devoted himself as a child would to its mother.<br><br>In his best-known 

        evocation of the Goddess, Ramakrishna observes her as a graceful young 

        woman sinuously emerging from the waters of the Ganges. As her belly breaks 

        forth from the waves, we realize that she is late in pregnancy, coming 

        to dry land to deliver her child. When she reaches the shore, she gives 

        birth to a beautiful baby whom she fondles affectionately and lifts to 

        her breast, where the child suckles until it is content. Holding her baby 

        once more in her arms, the woman becomes the Kali we are more familiar 

        with, a frightening old hag, gaunt with age and hunger. In her ferocious 

        aspect, Kali then lifts the infant to her mouth, crushes it between her 

        teeth and swallows the baby whole. Without a backward glance, she returns 

        to the waters from which she emerged, disappearing again from view. Kali's 

        Essence: Creator, Destroyer, Transformer<br><br>In his vignette Ramakrishna captures 

        the essence of Kali as Mother Nature in her creative, nurturing and destructive 

        aspects. Surrender to such a deity is hard to imagine until we realize 

        that it is not viciousness that motivates her destruction. Kali is by 

        necessity both the good and the terrible mother. Every nursing woman has 

        to sustain herself in order to nourish her children, and since Kali is 

        the mother of everything in the world, she has to feed on her children 

        as there is nothing else to eat.<br><br> Hinduism's world mother exemplifies 

        the fact that life often creates through destroying, just as we humans 

        recreate our bodies anew each day by destroying the plants and animals 

        on which we feed. What Kali vividly demonstrates is that we live in a 

        unified ecosystem, the interconnected web of all existence, each a part 

        of the other. Ramakrishna's image forces us to confront our place in the 

        food chain. Kali gives birth to us; we are sustained by eating her other 

        children; and finally we are eaten in turn. Life feeds on life. Life is 

        a sacrifice to life. These are the sacred truths that such a picture opens 

        to our view.<br><br>Kali continually takes away with her left hand what she provides 

        with her right, but just as continually replaces with her right hand what 

        the left has destroyed. This bloodthirsty goddess, as a unified vision 

        of life-death-and-rebirth, allows us in the West to see that the bright 

        and dark sides of the sacred are just human divisions of one holy reality, 

        and that when we participate in that divine reality we too are wild, unbound, 

        free. For the sacred that Kali represents cannot be circumscribed. It 

        is utterly free from the constraints of human imagination, beyond all 

        our experience, encompassing both life and death, darkness and light, 

        order and chaos, everything and the void. Facing Personal Mortality It 

        is no surprise to me that in India people acknowledge death as an inevitable 

        part of life, just as they see darkness as half the daily round. But I 

        know in my life facing mortality has not been an easy process. When I 

        turned 40 I was depressed for months and only discovered at the end of 

        this period that my low energy was due to the fact that I was coming to 

        grips with my not-so-imminent demise. Now having reached 50, I find myself 

        drawn to Kali for the same reasons that I couldn't face her earlier in 

        this decade. I have found a paradoxical freedom in accepting this ultimate 

        limitation in my life. It has spurred me on to enjoy life moment by moment.<br><br>In 

        many ways my attitude is like the Epicurean motto "Eat, drink and be merry, 

        for tomorrow we die." Most people in the 20th century interpret this sentiment 

        as a hedonistic, and therefore, non-spiritual response to mortality. But 

        in truth, living in the moment is highly spiritual, more like "praying 

        without ceasing" than drunken revelry. For to live in the charged atmosphere 

        of the present -- full of light and darkness -- is to feel gratitude for 

        the blessing of life.<br><br>When I am fully present in the here and now, I open 

        my senses wide to the world -- I notice the play of light on a forested 

        path, feel the soft humidity on my skin in the summer or the crisp fall 

        air when the season finally turns, smell the sweet and acrid perfume of 

        a late fall day, notice the stark contrasts in a winter landscape or hear 

        the returning warblers in the spring. Confronting death allows me to take 

        in more of the world than I do with my typical adult attitudes based on 

        norms and propriety and ultimately on fear. Looking death squarely in 

        the face gives me the courage to be more childlike, delighting in the 

        awe and wonder that life presents to me everyday.<br><br> Once I've faced my 

        fear of death, I can say, "Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave where 

        is thy victory?" When I've met my biggest (and most realistic) fear head 

        on, why should I care about my smaller fears any longer? So what if the 

        neighbors think I'm crazy once in a while or if people can't deal with 

        my exuberance at times. When I'm flowing with life's pulse, in Kali's 

        mad dance, I celebrate it moment by moment. Her ancient hymn to life and 

        death, opens me to spontaneity and frees me from fear. Then I plunge into 

        life, awake, alive, in awe, with my heart open, finally taking those exciting 

        risks I've been putting off for far too long.<br>
