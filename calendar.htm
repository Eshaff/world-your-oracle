            "My book is out! Fair Winds Press published it in March this year. So I'm off and running to a variety of events, listed
            below. If you would like to sign up for one of my classes or workshops, I now have a Paypal account that you
            can use. You'll notice that it's less expensive if you prepay. However, if you would prefer, you can pay at the
            event. But please RSVP beforehand. Then I'll know how many people will be attending. Simply drop me an email
            at
            <a href="mailto:Nancy@mamamsminstrel.net">Nancy@mamamsminstrel.net</a>. In either case, I will confirm your registration
            by email.
        </p>

        <p>If you want to schedule an event, please contact Kristen Townsend at <a href="mailto:nancyveddershults@gmail.com">nancyveddershults@gmail.com</a><br>
