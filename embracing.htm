          <p align="left"> Everyone knows the story: a young man in his prime embarks on a quest and slays a monstrous dragon. In North America,
            we know this young man inside out. He's the hero, the champion, the winner in a battle of cosmic proportions.
            He wins the girl in the end and saves Western civilization to boot. Sword in hand, he dashes off to fight the
            good fight, taking charge of his life and creating a better world in the bargain. His courage is legendary, his
            strength renowned; he prevails with flying colors. He is St. George or Heracles, Siegfried or John Wayne, even
            Daniel Boone. Sometimes he's a cowboy, sometimes a soldier, sometimes he's a superhero.
            <br>

            <br> When we talk about rugged individualism or the self-made man, it's the dragon-slayer's story that paints
            the backdrop, lending a larger-than-life feel to our concepts. When we think about sports or politics, business
            or war, perhaps even love, it is the mythic hero who gives us a touchstone for what's happening. In his story,
            there are victors and villains, trials and temptations, obstacles to be overcome and dragons to be slain. <br>
            <br>

            <img src="images/dragon_ornate2_texture-opt.jpg" width="218" height="496" align="left">We know the hero. We model
            our lives on his story, even if we're female. We go off to work and deal with our dragon of a boss. We sit down
            to the computer and slay the demon of writer's block. We overcome whatever stands in our way -- fears, blocks
            or hurdles --, to accomplish what we're determined to do. Got a problem? Then whet your sword and slay that dragon.
            <br>

            <br> But who is the dragon? Why must it be killed? Why have we suppressed this mythological figure? And why does
            it keep coming back, rearing its ugly head, just to have it lopped off again? Is it simply a scaly monster that
            must be slain? An obstacle in our paths that needs to be eliminated? Or does it, like the hero, represent something
            substantial in our lives, something we need to consider? <br>

            <br> I answer these questions and more in my book-in-process, <b>The Dragon with a Thousand Faces: Retelling the Heroic Myth</b>. 
            This book looks at the snakes and dragons in our myths and legends. <b>The Dragon with a Thousand Faces</b> contains seven chapters 
            structured according to the seven chakras of the Hindu tradition. Within Hinduism, the serpent 
            goddess Kundalini, a dragon herself, is said to rise through the chakras of a person's body until she reaches the seventh 
            and enlightenment occurs. <b>The Dragon with a Thousand Faces</b> focuses on the seven areas associated with the chakras (survival, sex and sensuality, will, love, creativity,
            psyche and the sacred) and in the process, brings the reader enlightenment about the dragons in our lives: </p>
